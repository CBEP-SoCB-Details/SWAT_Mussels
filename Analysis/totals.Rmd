# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

In this Notebook, we apply the lessons from our detailed data review, and
generate a simplified data set that removes unused data, adds a
unique sample ID code, and removes duplicate records.

## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```
