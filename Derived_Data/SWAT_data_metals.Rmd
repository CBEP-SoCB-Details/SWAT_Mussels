# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

In this Notebook, we assemble a reduced data set containing certain data on
metals.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
#library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later in document
library(knitr)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set

library(LCensMeans)
```

# Load Data
We load extensively reviewed and cleaned data from the Derived_Data folder.
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fn <- 'SWAT_data_working.csv'
```

## Copy Data
```{r}
swat_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn),
                      col_types = cols(
                        .default = col_character(),
                        site_seq = col_double(),
                        year = col_double(),
                        sample_date = col_datetime(format = ""),
                        concentration = col_double(),
                        qualifier = col_character(),
                        rl = col_double(),
                        mdl = col_double(),
                        dilution_factor = col_double(),
                        conc_ugg = col_double(),
                        conc_ngg = col_double(),
                        rl_ugg = col_double(),
                        rl_ngg = col_double()
                      )) %>%
  mutate(sample_date = as.Date(sample_date))
```

## Focus on Dry Weght Basis Values Only
Data in the database also includes wet weight and lipid weight basis values.
```{r}
swat_data <- swat_data %>%
  filter(weight_basis == 'DRY') %>%
  select(-weight_basis)
```

## Select metals
### List of Metals
```{r}
metals_list <- read_excel(file.path(sibling,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "Parameter List") %>%
  mutate(Class = factor(Class)) %>%
  arrange(Class, PARAMETER) %>%
  filter(Class == "Metal") %>%
  pull(PARAMETER) %>%
  as.character()
metals_list
```

### Filter to Metals Only
```{r}
metals_data <- swat_data %>%
  filter(parameter %in% metals_list)
```

## Drop Values in Nanograms per Gram
```{r}
metals_data <- metals_data %>%
select(-conc_ngg, -rl_ngg)
```

## Address Non Detects
Metals are generally observed at relatively high concentrations compared to
organic contaminants, which makes it convenient to measure them in micrograms
per gram, rather than nanograms per gram.

In calculating totals, DEP staff replaced non-detects with zero, half the
reporting limits, or the reporting limits.  Her we calculate non-detects both
as half the reporting limit and using our log-likelihood method.
```{r}
metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  mutate(flag      = if_else(is.na(lab_qualifier),
                             FALSE,
                             if_else(lab_qualifier == 'U',
                                     TRUE,
                                     FALSE)),
         conc_RL   = if_else(flag, rl_ugg, conc_ugg),
         conc_HALF = if_else(flag, rl_ugg/2, conc_ugg),
         conc_ML   = sub_cmeans(conc_RL, flag))
```

# Save Results
```{r}
write_csv(metals_data, 'SWAT_metals_working.csv')
```
