# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

In this Notebook, we assemble a reduced data set containing certain analytic
totals.

Our preference is to calculate totals and other derived quantities directly, so
we know exactly how derived quantities were produced, can perform data
QA/QC, and directly model non detects. Unfortunately, it has proven difficult
to reconstruct exactly how analytic totals were calculated by DEP.  

DEP staff pointed us towards the detailed documentation in the 2017-2018 SWAT
data report for details, especially from page 64 onward for PAHs.  This provided
a detailed list of parameters used to summarize PAHs using common analytic
totals that can be compared on a more or less consistent basis with benchmarks
from Gulfwatch and NOAA's National Status and Trends studies.

>   Maine Department of Environmental Protection.  2019.  Surface Water Ambient
    Toxics Monitoring Program.  2017-2018 Report to the Joint Committee on
    Environmental and Natural Resources.  129th Legislature, First Session.

Due to changes from year to year in analytic methods, data from different years
was reported to DEP in slightly inconsistent ways, so the totals were also
handled differently each year. While it appears full details are available in
the DEP report, we decided direct use of the totals as calculated by DEP makes
better sense.

We principally use the totals provided by DEP. This poses challenges for
addressing dioxins (where totals are only available on a TEQ basis, not a mass
basis), and for DDT residues (because DDT residues were not calculated by DEP).
We need the DDT residues to make our presentation more directly comparable to
results from all our other toxics data sets.

It's fairly straightforward to calculate Dioxin and DDT residue totals.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

# Load Data
We load the extensively reviewed and cleaned data from the Derived_Data folder.
(This code contains unnecessary folder references, but it makes the code work 
from any of the four primary folders in the archive, facilitating code reuse.)

## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fn <- 'SWAT_data_working.csv'
```

## Copy Data
```{r}
swat_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn),
                      col_types = cols(
                        .default = col_character(),
                        site_seq = col_double(),
                        year = col_double(),
                        sample_date = col_datetime(format = ""),
                        concentration = col_double(),
                        qualifier = col_character(),
                        rl = col_double(),
                        mdl = col_double(),
                        dilution_factor = col_double(),
                        conc_ugg = col_double(),
                        conc_ngg = col_double(),
                        rl_ugg = col_double(),
                        rl_ngg = col_double()
                      )) %>%
  mutate(sample_date = as.Date(sample_date))
```

## Focus on Dry Weght Basis Values Only
Data in the database also includes wet weight and lipid weight basis values.
Most reference levels are based on values expressed on a dry weight or lipid
weight basis.

Restricting data to dry weight basis only eliminates data from earlier years.
Those data do not have associated moisture values, and so dry weight basis could
not be calculated. In preliminary analyses, we note that most earlier analyses
generally used different laboratories, making direct comparison difficult.
```{r}
swat_data <- swat_data %>%
  filter(weight_basis == 'DRY') %>%
  select(-weight_basis)
```

# Identify Pre-Calculated Totals
In the `SWAT_data_examination_PARAMETERS.Rmd` file, we looked at all parameters
in the source data, and identified all derived quantities, including totals.
We take a moment to identify totals here, by major parameter groups, showing
only to the versions that addressed non detects by using half the value of
the reporting limits.

## PAHs
According to the SWAT report cited above, only certain summaries are possible 
for older periods of time, when fewer compounds were studied, so there is a
trade-off between completeness and coverage.  We can demonstrate that by looking
at availability of summations over time.

```{r}
swat_data %>%
  filter(grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
         grepl('PAH', parameter)   &
         grepl('-H$', parameter)) %>%
  select(parameter, year, concentration) %>%
  unique() %>%
  group_by(parameter, year) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(! is.na(concentration)), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = n)
```
So the only significant change is that the 2007 and 2008 data are only reported
according to PAH-19 totals.

```{r}
swat_data %>%
  filter(grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
         grepl('PAH', parameter)   &
         grepl('-H$', parameter)
         ) %>%
  select(parameter) %>%
  unique()
```

## PCBs
In the `SWAT_data_examination_PCB.Rmd` file, we identified three pre-calculated
totals for PCBs, and noted that an important reference total was NOT pre
calculated.  

```{r}
swat_data %>%
  filter((grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
         grepl('PCB', parameter)   &
         (grepl('-H$', parameter) |
          grepl('\\/2', parameter))) |
           parameter == 'PCBS') %>%
  select(parameter, year, concentration) %>%
  unique() %>%
  group_by(parameter, year) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(! is.na(concentration)), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = n)
```
`PCBS` and `TOTAL PCB-H` are nearly identical, and `TOTAL PCB-H` is available
more consistently, and has higher resolution, so we will use that in preference
to the "PCBS" value.

```{r}
swat_data %>%
  filter(grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
         grepl('PCB', parameter)   &
         (grepl('-H$', parameter) |
          grepl('\\/2', parameter)))
```

## Dioxins (and Furans)
There is only a single relevant Total for us to examine. We note that dioxins
were only studied in 2008, and only from the Presumpscot River sites, so there
is, perhaps, little reason to report on them here.
```{r}
swat_data %>%
  filter(grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
         grepl('DX', parameter)    &
         (grepl('ND=1\\/2 DL', parameter) |
             grepl('-H$', parameter))) %>%
  select(parameter) %>%
  unique()
```
That is in toxic equivalents, not on a mass basis. Because we have not
introduced the idea of toxic equivalents elsewhere in State of the Bay, we
will not do so here. We will directly calculate our own total for Dioxins.

## Pesticides
```{r}
swat_data %>%
  filter(grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
         grepl('PESTICIDES', parameter) &
           grepl('-H$', parameter)) %>%
  select(parameter) %>%
  unique()
```

This collection of 21 pesticides does not match any of our other Toxics data
sources.  A complete total of all pesticides in these data would be even more
extensive. While either the full list or the `P`TOTAL PESTICIDES21-H` may be
of interest, they introduce additionl complexity in reporting results in State of
Casco Bay.

Elsewhere we have reported on DDT residues, which tend to be a significant
fraction of total pesticides.  We will again follow that practice here, although
we have to calculate this total *de novo*.


# Calculate Additional Reference Totals
There is a fair amount of repeated code in the next section, so the following
could probably be simplified by creating some utility functions, but by the time
that became obvious, we had working code, and so did not bother to refactor.

## PCBs
The logic and code for selecting the particular PCBs included in this calculated
sum is developed in the `SWAT_data_examination_PCBs.Rmd` Notebook.  In summary,
we are calculating a sum of PCBs that matches a sum used by Maine DEP to compare
Maine results to (older) reference studies at regional and national levels.

Maine DEP staff pointed us towards the documentation in a 2017-2018 SWAT report
for details of how totals were calculated. This provided a detailed list of
parameters used to summarize PCBs using analytic totals that can be compared on
a more or less consistent basis with benchmarks from Gulfwatch and NOAA's
National Status and Trends studies.

>   Maine Department of Environmental Protection.  2019.  Surface Water Ambient
    Toxics Monitoring Program.  2017-2018 Report to the Joint Committee on
    Environmental and Natural Resources.  129th Legislature, First Session.
    
See the other R Notebook for details and QA/QC checks.  The code here is lightly
modified from the code developed there, mostly to address the different naming
conventions.

Although we prefer to calculate ND estimates based on statistical methods,
we can not recalculate all totals in these data. If we change the methods
we use, that may throw off comparisons with reference levels. Maine DEP
calculated totals based on the conventions of replacing non-detects with zero,
half the reporting limit, or the reporting limit.  Here, we will replace
non-detects with half the reporting limit, for consistency with DEP practice.

### Load List of All PCBs
First we load a list of PCBs from `Parameter List.xlsx` and drop the provided
totals.  While this step is not strictly necessary, it offers somechances for
QA/QC checks, and minimizes chances of confusion later.  Most PCBS were reported
in the data by name, others (the co-eluted mixtures) as PAH numbers in
slash-delimited lists.  That's inconvenient, and requires much of the following
code to address.
```{r}
pcb_list <- read_excel(file.path(sibling,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "Parameter List") %>%
  mutate(Class = factor(Class)) %>%
  arrange(Class, PARAMETER) %>%
  
  # Restrict to PCBs data
  filter(grepl('PCB', Class)) %>%
  
  # Drop TOTALS
  filter(! grepl('TOTAL', PARAMETER)) %>%
  filter(! PARAMETER == 'PCBS') %>%
  
  pull(PARAMETER) %>%
  as.character()
```

### Load PCB Nomenclature Table
This is a look up table that converts among common ways of referring to PCBs.
The added data columns just convert entries in the look up table to match 
conventions in the DEP data.
```{r}
pcb_translator <-  read_excel(file.path(sibling,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "PCB Nomenclature")%>%
  mutate(casrn = gsub('-','', CASRN),
         iupac_name = toupper(`IUPAC Name`))
```

### Calculate `pcb_congener name`
The `swat_list` (loaded later) a]is expressed in PAH Congener Numbers ONLY,
which are not consistently reported in the source data.

We generate a new column of PCB names, by matching CAS number. The new data
column includes the new names where matches occur, and retains the old names,
where they already are in PCB number format (specifically for co-eluted
mixtures).
```{r}
pcb_data <- swat_data %>%
  # limit data to PCBs
  filter(parameter %in% pcb_list) %>%
  
  # Add data on congener numbers
  left_join(pcb_translator, by = c("cas_no" = "casrn")) %>%
  select(-CASRN, -Descriptor, -Type, -`IUPAC Name`, -iupac_name)  %>%

  # Create pcb_congener_name data
  mutate(pcb_number = paste0('PCB-', `Congener Number`) ) %>%
  mutate(pcb_congener_name = if_else(grepl('PCB', parameter),
                            parameter,
                            pcb_number)) %>%
    
  # Address non-matches, where we want NAs, not a misleading code
  mutate(pcb_congener_name = if_else(pcb_congener_name == 'PCB-NA',
                                       NA_character_,
                                       pcb_congener_name)) %>% 
  # Cleanup
  select(-`Congener Number`, -pcb_number)
```

#### Are All PCB Congeners Represented?
We Check to confirm everything so far has worked as expected. If so, each
congener number will turn up exactly once.  The magic function here is
`separate_rows()`.
```{r}
pcb_data %>%
  select(pcb_congener_name) %>%
  unique() %>%
  mutate(available_nums  = sub('PCB-', '', pcb_congener_name)) %>%
  separate_rows(available_nums) %>%
  mutate(available_nums = as.numeric(available_nums)) %>%
  arrange(available_nums)
```

### Load "SWAT PCBs" Parameter List
The list of parameters we want to include in the sum is pulled from
Table 1.3.3.1.1 in the DEP SWAT report.
```{r}
swat_list <- read_excel(file.path(sibling,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "PCB_SWAT") %>%
  pull(SWAT_PCBs_35)
swat_list
```
And those names all match parameters in `pcb_congener_name`, as required.

### Calculate "SWAT PCBs" Sum
here we actually calculate the sums, and begin to build up complete
data rows to include in the totals data.
```{r}
pcb_swat <- pcb_data %>%
  # Filter to SWAT PCB codes
  filter(pcb_congener_name %in% swat_list) %>%
  
  # Address NDs, We could add code to estimate NDs by maximum likelihood.
  # We calculate based on ng/g to avoid unit confusion.  The original data
  # was in pg/g.  We correct the units in a moment.
  mutate(conc = if_else(is.na(lab_qualifier), conc_ngg,
                        if_else(lab_qualifier == 'U',
                                rl_ngg/2,
                                conc_ngg))) %>%
  
  # Calculate sums across SWAT PCBs for each sample or subsample.
  # And add parameter-specific metadata.
  group_by(code, lab_id) %>%
  summarize(concentration = sum(conc, na.rm = TRUE),
            conc_ngg = concentration,
            conc_ugg = concentration / 1000,
            parameter = 'SWAT_PCBs-H',
            units     = 'NG/G',
            method = 'Calculated',
            .groups   = 'drop') 
pcb_swat
```

### Assemble Full Data Rows
We  add in sample-specific metadata to full out the rest of the data we need to
analyze the calculated values from a moment ago.
```{r}
# Select the first matching record.  We might actually get a few too many,
# Since we search for all records that match the sample code.
# But that will be addressed by the inner join.
ancillary_data <- pcb_data %>%
  filter(code %in% pcb_swat$code ) %>%
  group_by(code, lab_id) %>%
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>%
 
  # Drop any data that is sample-specific.  We simply drop those data
  # columns.  When we `bind_rows()` later, missing columns will be filled in 
  # with NA.
  select(-c(method:pcb_congener_name))

# Finally, we use the inner join to combine data
pcb_swat <- ancillary_data %>%
  inner_join(pcb_swat, by = c('code', 'lab_id'))
pcb_swat
```

#### Cleanup
```{r}
rm(pcb_data, pcb_translator, pcb_list, ancillary_data, swat_list)
```

## Dioxins and Furans
### List of Dioxins and Furans
First we load a list of dioxins from `Parameter List.xlsx`.
```{r}
dioxins_list <- read_excel(file.path(sibling,"Parameter List.xlsx"), 
                             sheet = "Parameter List") %>%
  mutate(Class = factor(Class)) %>%
  arrange(Class, PARAMETER) %>%
  filter(Class == "Dioxin") %>%
  pull(PARAMETER) %>%
  as.character()
dioxins_list
```

###  Calculate Total Dioxins
We calculate a sum across all the dioxins studied, addressing non-detects while
we are at it.

Although we prefer to calculate ND estimates based on statistical methods,
we can not recalculate all totals in these data, because of
inconsistencies in how some data were reported. Maine DEP calculated totals
based on the conventions of replacing non-detects with zero, half the reporting
limit, or the reporting limit.  Here, we will replace non-detects with half the
reporting limit, for consistency with DEP practice.

```{r}
dioxin_data <- swat_data %>%
  # Filter to dioxin residues
  filter(parameter %in% dioxins_list) %>%
  
  # Address NDs, working only with nanogram per gram data
  mutate(conc = if_else(is.na(lab_qualifier), conc_ngg,
                        if_else(lab_qualifier == 'U',
                                rl_ngg/2,
                                conc_ngg))) %>%
  
  # Calculate sums across parameters
  group_by(code) %>%
  summarize(concentration = sum(conc, na.rm = TRUE),
            conc_ngg = concentration,
            conc_ugg = concentration / 1000,
            parameter = 'Total Dioxins and Furans',
            units     = 'NG/G',
            method = 'Calculated',
            .groups   = 'drop') 
dioxin_data
```
Note we only have Dioxin Data from four samples, all from one site and one year.

Now, we need to assemble full rows of data.  We do that by selecting an
arbitrary row from the matching sample, stripping out all parameter specific
information, leaving only the sample-specific data, and then joining the
stripped down data data with the dioxin_data.

### Assemble Full Data Rows
```{r}
# Select the first matching record.  We might actually get a few too many,
# Since we search for all records that match the sample code.
ancillary_data <- swat_data %>%
  filter(code %in% dioxin_data$code ) %>%
  group_by(code) %>%
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>%
  
  # Now, drop any data that is sample-specific.  We simply drop those data
  # columns.  When we `bind_rows()` later, missing columns will be filled in 
  # with NA.
  
  select(-c(method:rl_ngg))

# Finally, we use the inner join to combine data
dioxin_data <- ancillary_data %>%
  inner_join(dioxin_data, by = c('code'))
dioxin_data
rm(ancillary_data)
```

## DDT Residues
We can pull the DDT, DDE, and DDD parameters with a simple regex.  Once we
identify these records, we can calculate totals and add them to the data set for
further analysis.
```{r}
swat_data %>%
  filter(grepl('DD[TDE]', parameter)) %>%
  select(parameter) %>%
  unique()
```

We have non-detects reported in these data, so we need to deal with them. 

Although we prefer to calculate ND estimates based on statistical methods,
we can not recalculate all the other totals in these data, because of
inconsistencies in how they were reported. We have to rely on the calculated
totals by DEP staff, which reported totals treating ND as zero, half the
Reporting Limit (RL), or equal to the RL.

Of those three options, we have selected the option that non-detects are
replaced with one half of the detection limits.
### Calculate Total DDT Residues
```{r}
ddt_data <- swat_data %>%
  # Filter to DDT residues, (dry weight only was set earlier)
  filter(grepl('DD[TDE]', parameter)) %>%
  #filter(weight_basis == 'DRY') %>%
  
  # Address NDs
  mutate(conc = if_else(is.na(lab_qualifier), conc_ngg,
                        if_else(lab_qualifier == 'U',
                                rl_ngg/2,
                                conc_ngg))) %>%
  
  # Calculate sums across parameters
  group_by(code, lab_id) %>%
  summarize(concentration = sum(conc, na.rm = TRUE),
            conc_ngg = concentration,
            conc_ugg = concentration / 1000,
            parameter = 'Total DDT',
            units     = 'NG/G',
            method = 'Calculated',
            .groups   = 'drop') 
ddt_data
```


### Assemble Full Data Rows
Now, we need to assemble full rows of data.  We do that by selecting an
arbitrary row from the matching sample, stripping out all parameter specific
information, leaving only the sample-specific data, and then joining the
stripped down data data with the ddt_data.

```{r}
# Select the first matching record.  We might actually get a few too many,
# Since we search for all records that match EITHER the code or the lab_id.
# And we only need the ones that match BOTH, but that's OK for now, since we 
# will use an inner join later, which will only keep matches.
ancillary_data <- swat_data %>%
  filter(code %in% ddt_data$code & lab_id %in% ddt_data$lab_id) %>%
  group_by(code, lab_id) %>%
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>%
  
  # Now, drop any data that is sample-specific.  We simply drop those data
  # columns.  When we `bind_rows()` later, missing columns wil lbe filled in 
  # with NA.
  
  select(-c(method:rl_ngg))

# Finally, we use the inner join to combine data

ddt_data <- ancillary_data %>%
  inner_join(ddt_data, by = c('code', 'lab_id'))
ddt_data
```

# Assemble the Totals data
## Select Precalculated Totals
Recall, we are looking only at totals expressed on a dry weight basis.
```{r}
totals_data <- swat_data %>%
  filter((grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
         grepl('PAH', parameter)   &
         grepl('-H$', parameter))                  |
           
         ((grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
             grepl('PCB', parameter)) &
           (grepl('ND=1\\/2 DL', parameter) |
             grepl('-H$', parameter)) )           |  # We dropped "PAHS" here
           
         (grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
         grepl('DX', parameter)    &
         (grepl('ND=1\\/2 DL', parameter) |
             grepl('-H$', parameter)))            |
           
         (grepl('TOTAL', parameter) &
          grepl('PESTICIDES', parameter) &
           grepl('-H$', parameter) ) )
         
```

## Add "SWAT PCBs", Dioxin and DDT Totals
```{r}
totals_data <- totals_data %>%
  bind_rows(pcb_swat)
  bind_rows(dioxin_data)
  bind_rows(ddt_data)
```

# Save Totals Data
```{r}
write_csv(totals_data, 'SWAT_totals_working.csv')
```
