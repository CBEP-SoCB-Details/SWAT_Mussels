# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Unfortunately, the data delivery contains little metadata, so it takes some
effort to understand the data format and analyze it correctly.

In this Notebook we review the structure of the data to determine which data
columns contain useful information, and derive rules for working with the data.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later in document
library(knitr)
```
# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(sibling, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))

before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

## Remove duplicates
Many samples -- nearly 20% -- are members of a group of duplicates.  We can
think of no valid reason why two records should be exact duplicates in this
setting, so we remove all duplicates using the unique() function.
```{r remove_duplicates}
SWAT_data <- unique(SWAT_data)
```


# Totals And Calculations
Many parameters are TOTALS or Calculated sums of related contaminants. These are
derived parameters which may be of particular iterest, but they are not primary
analytic values.
```{r}
SWAT_data %>%
  select(PARAMETER, `TEST METHOD`) %>%
  filter(grepl('TOTAL', PARAMETER, ignore.case = TRUE) |
         grepl('CALCULATED', `TEST METHOD`)) %>%
  group_by(`TEST METHOD`, PARAMETER) %>%
  summarize(Test      =  first(`TEST METHOD`), # Only needed for 
                        .groups = 'drop') %>%
  rename(Parameter = PARAMETER) %>%
  kable()
```

## Alternate Versions of Totals?
Many TOTAL parameters come in triplets -- with a suffix of "-D', or '-H' or '-O'. It
appears those are for totals calculated using different assumptions about how to
address non-detects, with  -D stands for "detection limit", -H stands for "Half
Detection Limit", and -0 stands for "Zero".

If that's the case, any total with -D is greater than or equal to related Totals
with -H, which in turn will be greater than any total with -O

```{r}
tmp <- SWAT_data %>%
  filter (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  select(SAMPLE_ID, SAMPLE_DATE, PARAMETER, `ANALYSIS LAB`,
         `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`, CONCENTRATION) %>%
  filter(grepl('TOTAL', PARAMETER, ignore.case = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(grepl('-[DHO]$', PARAMETER)) %>%
  mutate(suffix = substr(PARAMETER, nchar(PARAMETER), nchar(PARAMETER)),
         prefix = substr(PARAMETER, 1, nchar(PARAMETER)-2))
tmp
```

But we have some duplicates in here ....
```{r}
tmp  %>% group_by(SAMPLE_ID, SAMPLE_DATE, `ANALYSIS LAB`,
                  ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, prefix, suffix) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            d = max(CONCENTRATION)- min(CONCENTRATION),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(n>1)
```
Those appear to be  duplicates with exactly the same value in CONCENTRATION, and
no other obvious discrepancies.



# How to Group Parameters
One of the challenges is that we want to report totals of various groups of
parameters, but the data contains no flag for major types of parameters.  We
probably need to make a lookup table to be consistent.

The closest thing to an indicator of the groupings of parameters in use is the
`TEST METHOD` field, which provides a method code. It is possible that we could
generate a pretty good starting point for a lookup code based on that, or it
may be quicker to produce one by hand.

## Export a Preliminary list of Parameters
After we get a list of Parameters, we will amend it by hand in Excel
to indicate which group each parameter falls within.

```{r}
SWAT_data %>%
  select(PARAMETER, `TEST METHOD`) %>%
  group_by(`TEST METHOD`, PARAMETER) %>%
  summarize(Test      =  first(`TEST METHOD`),
                        .groups = 'drop') %>%
  rename(Parameter = PARAMETER) %>%
  select(-Test) %>%
  kable()
```

# Totals And Calculations
Many parameters are TOTALS or Calculated sums of related contaminants. These are
derived parameters which may be of particular iterest, but they are not primary
analytic values.
```{r}
SWAT_data %>%
  select(PARAMETER, `TEST METHOD`) %>%
  filter(grepl('TOTAL', PARAMETER, ignore.case = TRUE) |
         grepl('CALCULATED', `TEST METHOD`)) %>%
  group_by(`TEST METHOD`, PARAMETER) %>%
  summarize(Test      =  first(`TEST METHOD`),
                        .groups = 'drop') %>%
  rename(Parameter = PARAMETER) %>%
  kable()
```

### Alternate Versions of Totals?
Many TOTAL parameters come in triplets -- with a suffix of "-D', or '-H' or '-O'. It
appears those are for totals calculated using different assumptions about how to
address non-detects, with  -D stands for "detection limit", -H stands for "Half
Detection Limit", and -0 stands for "Zero".

If that's the case, any total with -D is greater than or equal to related Totals
with -H, which in turn will be greater than any total with -O

```{r}
tmp <- SWAT_data %>%
  filter (`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'WET') %>%
  select(SAMPLE_ID, SAMPLE_DATE, PARAMETER, `ANALYSIS LAB`,
         `ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID`, CONCENTRATION) %>%
  filter(grepl('TOTAL', PARAMETER, ignore.case = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(grepl('-[DHO]$', PARAMETER)) %>%
  mutate(suffix = substr(PARAMETER, nchar(PARAMETER), nchar(PARAMETER)),
         prefix = substr(PARAMETER, 1, nchar(PARAMETER)-2))
tmp
```

But we have some duplicates in here ....
```{r}
tmp  %>% group_by(SAMPLE_ID, SAMPLE_DATE, `ANALYSIS LAB`,
                  ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, prefix, suffix) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            d = max(CONCENTRATION)- min(CONCENTRATION),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(n>1)
```
Those appear to be  duplicates with exactly the same value in CONCENTRATION, and
no other obvious discrepancies.

```{r}
SWAT_data %>%
  filter (SAMPLE_ID == 'CBEEEE REP 1',
          as.Date(SAMPLE_DATE) == as.Date('2007-10-31'),
          PARAMETER == 'TOTAL PAH19-O' | 
            PARAMETER == 'TOTAL PAH19-H' |
             PARAMETER == 'TOTAL PAH19-D' )

```
So, looking at that site we again see no differences. This appears to be a
sample duplication in the data record.  It's not the only one.

Since these are apparent duplicates, we lose no information by  averaging the
two values.  Here we check to make sure the different totals fall in the
expoected sequence order.
```{r}
tmp %>%
  group_by(SAMPLE_ID, SAMPLE_DATE, `ANALYSIS LAB`, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, prefix, suffix) %>%
  summarize (CONCENTRATION = mean(CONCENTRATION, na.rm = TRUE),
          .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pivot_wider(c(SAMPLE_ID, SAMPLE_DATE, `ANALYSIS LAB`, ANALYSIS_LAB_SAMPLE_ID, prefix),
              names_from = suffix,
              values_from = CONCENTRATION) %>%
  mutate(test = D >= H & H >= O) %>%
filter(! test)
```

Some of the TOTALS are inexplicable, since they are "totals" of single parameters, like PAH-19, which is a name for a single compound. Are they perhaps surrogates used in the calculations that incorporate detection limits?

```{r}
SWAT_data %>%  filter (grepl('TOTAL PAH', PARAMETER)) %>%
  select (EGAD_SITE_NAME, CURRENT_SAMPLE_POINT_NAME, `SAMPLE_DATE`, `ANALYSIS LAB`, PARAMETER)
```
They are all 2007 or 2009 samples from AXYS ANALYTICAL SERVICES.  They all appear to include the -D -H or -O modifiers, which suggests they are totals making different assumptions about how to handle non-detects.  But the point is, these are derived quanities, not primary quantities.


##  Read Excel File with Classification of Parameters
We can then read in the resulting Excel File to provide groupings...
```{r}
Parameter_List <- read_excel("Parameter List.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Parameter List") %>%
  mutate(Class = factor(Class)) %>%
  arrange(Class, PARAMETER)
Parameter_List
```


SWAT_data %>% 
 # filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'LIP') %>%
  group_by(CAS_NO) %>%
  summarize(nnames = length(unique(PARAMETER)),
            name = first (PARAMETER),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(name) %>%
  mutate(match(Parameter_List))



#  PCB Nomenclature
Many of the PCBs chemical names and the PCB numerical designations turn up in
the same number of composite samples, which suggests they are reported on the
same samples  .  I wonder if these represent duplicate data.


## Examining CAS numbers
Lets see how many times we have duplicate values with the same CAS number.

```{r}
SWAT_data %>% 
 # filter(`WEIGHT BASIS` == 'LIP') %>%
  group_by(CAS_NO) %>%
  summarize(nnames = length(unique(PARAMETER)),
            name = first (PARAMETER),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(name)
```
That suggests we have no duplicates.

Looking closely, all the PCBs listed by PCB number are in fact mixtures of PCBs.
So technically, they are NOT individual PCBs, and should not overlap with PCBs
by CAS NUmber.  The question is, how are they used?  And especially, how are the
total PCBs calculated?

Lets pull one sample and look at that.

## When Are the PCB numerical codes used?
