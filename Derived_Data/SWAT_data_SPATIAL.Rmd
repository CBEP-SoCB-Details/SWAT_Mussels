# Introduction
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) maintains a large database
of environmental data called "EGAD".  Citizens can request data from the
database through DEP staff.

CBEP requested data from DEP on levels of toxic contaminants in shellfish
tissue samples from Casco Bay. The result is a large (> 100,000 line) excel
spreadsheet containing data from about 40 sampling dates from 20 locations, over
a period of more than 15 years.

Unfortunately, the data delivery contains little metadata, so it takes some
effort to understand the data format and analyze it correctly. Among other
problems, we need to understand dates and locations of samples, what analytes
were used for different samples, etc.

In this notebook we extract geospatial data from source data files for further
analysis. This Notebook generates the following derived data files:

`sample_spatial.csv`
`sites_spatial.csv`

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
#library(htmltools)  # used by knitr called here only to avoid startup text later in document
library(knitr)

```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
siblingfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,siblingfldnm)
fn <- 'CascoBaySWATtissue_Bohlen.xlsx'
```

## Copy TOXICS Data
This is a larger data file that takes some time to load.  Getting the column
types right dramatically improves load speed. Much of the data is qualitative,
and can't be handled in R.
```{r copy_data}
SWAT_data <- read_excel(file.path(sibling, fn), 
    sheet = "Mussels Data", col_types = c("numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "date", "text", "numeric", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text"))

before <- nrow(SWAT_data)
```

### List of Sites
We pull apart the site name into a site code and a longer name.
```{r}
sites <- SWAT_data %>%
  select(`SITE SEQ`, `EGAD_SITE_NAME`) %>%
  group_by(`SITE SEQ`, `EGAD_SITE_NAME`) %>%
  summarize(SiteCode =  first(sub('.* - ','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)), 
            Site =  first(sub(' - .*','', `EGAD_SITE_NAME`)),
                        .groups = 'drop') %>%
  select(-`EGAD_SITE_NAME`)
#write_csv(sites, 'cb_SWAT_sites_list.csv')
kable(sites)
```


## Copy Geographic Locations
In addition to the toxics data, we received a separate Excel file containing
geospatial data.  That data includes repeat geographic data for each site, often
also providing  information on separate sample collection locations within
sites. As far as we have been able to tell, however, there is no consistent
sample identifier between the geographic data and toxics data as received.

We lack precise metadata on geographic coordinates. We do know locations were
collected in most cases with hand-held GPS units, which suggests lat-long data
are probably in WGS 1984.

Here we assemble an initial geospatial data set by reading in the source data,
and formatting it for GIS use.

### Complete Data, Including Sample Locations
Data on Sample Locations shows locations were at some sites collected over a
kilometer of shoreline or more, however, data on Sample Locations appears
incomplete, and so the best we can do is work with the site data, which while
lower resolution is complete for all samples.
```{r}
fn <- 'CascoBay_SWAT_Spatial.xlsx'
samples_spatial_data <- read_excel(file.path(sibling, fn))%>%
  mutate(`SITE UTM X` = as.numeric(`SITE UTM X`),
         `SITE UTM Y` = as.numeric(`SITE UTM Y`),
         `SITE LATITUDE` = as.numeric(`SITE LATITUDE`),
         `SITE LONGITUDE` = as.numeric(`SITE LONGITUDE`),
         `SAMPLE POINT UTM X` = as.numeric(`SAMPLE POINT UTM X`),
         `SAMPLE POINT UTM Y` = as.numeric(`SAMPLE POINT UTM Y`),
         `SAMPLE POINT LATITUDE` = as.numeric(`SAMPLE POINT LATITUDE`),
         `SAMPLE POINT LONGITUDE` = as.numeric(`SAMPLE POINT LONGITUDE`),
  )
```

### Site Locations Only
Reduced data set, which will be the basis for most mapping. Note that this data
set (at this point) includes some locations that were used for samples of tissue
from other shellfish.
```{r}
sites_spatial_data <- samples_spatial_data  %>%
  rename(SITESEQ = `SITE SEQ`) %>%
    group_by(SITESEQ) %>%
    summarize(SITECODE  = first(sites$SiteCode[match(SITESEQ, sites$`SITE SEQ`)]),
              SITE  = first(sites$Site[match(SITESEQ, sites$`SITE SEQ`)]),
              UTM_E = first(`SITE UTM X`),
              UTM_N = first(`SITE UTM Y`),
              LAT   = first(`SITE LATITUDE`),
              LONG  = first(`SITE LONGITUDE`),
              .groups = 'drop') 
```

## Write CSV file for GIS
We filter out sites that were NOT included in the mussel tissue toxics data.

Without na = '', literal 'NA' in the output was sometimes forcing ArcGIS to
interpret data columns as text, forcing conversions in GIS.
```{r}
sites_spatial_data <- sites_spatial_data %>%
  filter(! is.na(SITECODE))
write_csv(sites_spatial_data, 'sites_spatial.csv', na = '')
```

ArcGIS was having trouble reading earlier drafts of the following file, so we
simplified by removing spaces from column names and removing NAs.

```{r} 
samples_spatial_data %>%
  select ( -`SITE UTM X`, -`SITE UTM Y`, -`SITE LATITUDE`, -`SITE LONGITUDE`,
           - DATA_SOURCE, -LOCATION_ACCURACY, -LOCATION_METHOD) %>%
  rename_all(~gsub(' ', '', .)) %>%
  write_csv('samples_spatial.csv', na = '')
```
